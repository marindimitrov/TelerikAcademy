        <span>C</span>ascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting 
        of a document written in a markup language. While most often used to style web pages and interfaces 
        written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any kind of XML document, including plain 
        XML, SVG and XUL. CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of document content from document 
        presentation, including elements such as the layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve 
        content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation 
        characteristics, enable multiple pages to share formatting, and reduce complexity and repetition in 
        the structural content (such as by allowing for tableless web design).
